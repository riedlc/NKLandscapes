Hi, this is an early version of a package designed to generate nk fitness landscapes as defined by Stuart Kauffman (see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NK_model). 

This package has 3 dependencies: numpy, itertools, and random.

I HAVE NOT PERFORMED VERSION COMPATIBILITY TESTING ON THIS PACKAGE
    
Currently runs with: numpy.__version__ => '1.25.2'
        
Check out Examples.ipynb for a primer on how to use this package!
